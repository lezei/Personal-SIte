            <h1>JavaScript</h1>
            <small>Write Less, Do More</small>
            <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.</p>
            <h3>Functions</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/JavaScript-logo.png" alt="cat">
            <p>Quite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the script.
For example, we need to show a nice-looking message when a visitor logs in, logs out and maybe somewhere else.
Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.
We’ve already seen examples of built-in functions, like alert(message), prompt(message, default) and confirm(question). But we can create functions of our own as well.</p>
